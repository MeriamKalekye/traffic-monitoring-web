#  Nairobi Smart Traffic Monitoring System

This is a React-based web application for visualizing simulated traffic conditions in Nairobi. Itâ€™s part of my academic project focused on data visualization and intelligent environments.

##  Project Features

- Interactive traffic maps for Nairobi
- Simulated IoT data for vehicle speed, count, and congestion levels
- Responsive UI built using React
- Data exploration and visualizations designed for Nairobi's real-world challenges

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Simulation:** Local mock traffic data
- **Visualization:** Charts, maps, and dynamic UI elements
- **(Optional/Removed)** ELK Stack (previously used for backend simulation via Docker)

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeriamKalekye/traffic-monitoring-web.git
   cd traffic-monitoring-web
